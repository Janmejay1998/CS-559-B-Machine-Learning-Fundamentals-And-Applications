Problem 1. Linear Discriminant Analysis
Please download the Iris data set from the UCI Machine Learning repository and implement Linear 
Discriminant Analysis for each pair of the classes and report your results. Note that there are three (3) 
class labels in this data set. To implement these models, you can use python and the sklearn packages. 
Please submit the code along with each step of your solutions to get full points.

Problem 2. Gradient Descent Algorithm and Logistic Regression
Please download the breast cancer data set from UCI Machine Learning repository. Implement your 
Logistic regression classifier with ML estimator using Stochastic gradient descent and Mini-Batch 
gradient descent algorithms. Do not use any package/tool. Use cross-validation for evaluation and 
report the recall, precision, and accuracy on malignant class prediction (class label malignant is 
positive). Write down each step of your solution.
